# Earthquake Map Project

## Overview
The Earthquake Map Project is a web-based application that helps users visualize recent earthquakes happening around the world. It uses data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to provide a clear and engaging way to understand seismic activity.

## What It Does
- **Shows Recent Earthquakes**: The map displays the locations of recent earthquakes, allowing users to see where and when they occurred.
- **Color-Coded Circles**: Each earthquake is represented by a circle on the map. The color of the circle indicates how deep the earthquake was, while the size of the circle shows how strong it was.
- **Interactive Information**: Users can click on the circles to get more details about each earthquake, such as its location and magnitude.

## How to Use It
1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Explore the map to see recent earthquakes.
3. Click on any circle to learn more about that specific event.
